## SUMMARY:
 This draws a sine, cos, and tangent graph.
 What I did was I cleaned up the part where it draws the axis.  I added a function that chances the color of the sine curve.  I added a function that took parameters in order to draw a circle. I also added a function that returns whether or not the circle is on the left or right side!
